NdnRtc-Addon:  Chat and Conference Discovery Addon for NdnRtc
--------------------------------------------------------------
This shared library implements Chrono-Chat and Conference Discovery.

Chrono-chat is based on the design of chrono-chat2013 (http://irl.cs.ucla.edu/~zhenkai/papers/chronosync.pdf), and test-chrono-chat in NDN-CPP's tests. (https://github.com/named-data/ndn-cpp)

Conference-discovery is sync-based. To be expanded later.

These functions are going to be used in NdnRtc (https://github.com/remap/ndnrtc)

See the file [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/zhehaowang/ConferenceDiscovery/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for build and install instructions.
